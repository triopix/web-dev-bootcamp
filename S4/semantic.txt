SEMANTIC MARKUP ("adding meaning to markup"):

- no new features, instead more MEANING

- "SEMANTIC" - relating to meaning in language
- "what purpose or role does that HTML element serve?"
- "what is the meaning of that HTML element?"

- elements that function like divs
- give more "meaning" to the structure of a document
- categorizing pieces of markup

- screen readers need headers/footers
- makes markup more readable/navigable
- still functions like a div/span, but with more meaning
- semantic elements are more descriptive

Instead of <div> or <span>, use more specific elements like:

- <section> - for sections of a document

- <article> - for self-contained content

 - independently reusable/distributable like a weather widget (reusable)
 - can be reused in different contexts
 - <header> - for the header of a section or article
 - <footer> - for the footer of a section or article

- <header> - for the header of a document
- <footer> - for the footer of a document
- <nav> - for navigation links
- <aside> - for sidebars, callout boxes, etc.
- <figure> - for images, diagrams, etc.
- <figcaption> - caption for a figure
- <main> - the main content of the document
- <time> - a specific time or date
- <mark> - highlighted text
- <address> - contact information
- <progress> - a progress bar
- <meter> - a measurement within a range
- <summary> - a summary of a details element
