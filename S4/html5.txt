What is HTML5?

- LATEST EVOLUTION of the STANDARD that defines HTML
- markup language for documents DESIGNED to be displayed in a WEB BROWSER
- REFERS to a LARGER SET of technologies (HTML5 and friends)
- new stuff for CSS, upgrades for performance, 3D Grahpics support, etc...

HTML STANDARD:

- document that defines how HTML works
- browsers have to do the lifting and actually IMPLETMENT the standard


HTML5 is a WORKING DRAFT
HTML5 is a LIVING standard

it is not a new version of HTML
HTML5 is a new standard that is being developed
you don't "upgrade" to HTML5    

<!DOCTYPE html>
- you merely tell the browser what markup it should expect
- this is the DOCTYPE declaration
- tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in
- the DOCTYPE declaration is NOT an HTML tag
- it is an instruction to the web browser
- it is NOT case sensitive
- it is NOT required to be in the HTML document
- it is NOT required to be the first thing in the document
