"Root element of the HTML document"
"All tags must descend from this element"
<html>

"Title of the webpage - appears in the browser tab"
<title>
</title>

"Body of the webpage - where the content goes"

"Tags for example are <h1>, </h1>, and the contents inside are called "element contents"
"Them TOGETHER are called an element"
