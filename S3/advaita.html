    <h2>Basic Ideology</h2>
    <p>
      Vedānta) is a Hindu tradition of Brahmanical textual exegesis and
      philosophy, and a monastic institutional tradition nominally related to
      the Daśanāmi Sampradaya and propagated by the Smarta tradition. Its core
      tenet is that jivatman, the individual experiencing self, is ultimately
      pure awareness mistakenly identified with body and the senses,[2] and
      non-different ("na aparah") from Ātman/Brahman, the highest Self or
      Reality. Advaita Vedanta (/ʌdˈvaɪtə vɛˈdɑːntə/; Sanskrit: अद्वैत वेदान्त,
      IAST: Advaita
    </p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      The term Advaita literally means <b>"non-secondness"</b>, but is usually
      rendered as "nonduality".[6][7] This refers to the Oneness of Brahman,[8]
      the only real Existent, and is often equated with monism.[note 2]
