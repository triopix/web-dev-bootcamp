What is the internet?

"A global network of networks"
"Many computers connected together over a network"

Routers (instead of connecting every computer)
- operator in a call central
- connect every computer to that central place
- router's job is to provide information to everyone

Individual computers are identified by IP Adresses
No one computer needs to know about other computers

"Network of networks"

Data makes its way over cables!
Under-sea cables, etc...
Sent over pulses of light...
