The Request/Response Cycle:

- server's don't respond with a beautiful web page lol
- servers respond with INSTRUCTIONS
- browser's job is to RENDER the content (take code from HTTP response)

IKEA Instructions (not the final product): (server response)
Your Browser: (build the Sofa! from instructions)

When you do "view source" on right-click, you see the instructions!
Browser takes those and renders them into a beautiful web page!

HTML/CSS/JS are the instructions from (web-server)

- HTML: structure of the page
- CSS: style of the page
- JS: behavior of the page
